# 0. Preface

With the continuous iteration and improvement of [PouchContainer](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch), the project has grown larger, which has attracted many external developers to participate in the development of the project. Because each contributor's coding habits are different, the code reviewer's responsibility is not only to focus on logical correctness and performance issues, but also on code style, because a unified code specification is a prerequisite for maintaining project code maintainability. In addition to the unified project code style, the coverage and stability of test cases is also the focus of the project. In simple terms, in the absence of regression test cases, how do you ensure that each code update does not affect existing features?

This article shares PouchContainer's practices in code style specifications and golang unit test cases.

# 1. Unified coding style specification

PouchContainer is a project built by the golang language, we use shell scripts to perform automated operations such as compiling and packaging. In addition to golang and shell scripts, PouchContainer also contains a large number of Markdown-style documents, which is the entry point for users to understand PouchContainer. Its standard layout and correct spelling are also the focus of the project. The following sections describe the tools and usage scenarios that PouchContainer uses in coding style specifications.

## 1.1 Golinter - Unified coding style format.

The syntax of golang is simple, and the community has a complete [CodeReview](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) guide to make most golang projects have the same code style, rarely caught in the __ religion __ dispute. On the basis of the community, PouchContainer also defines some specific rules to stipulate the developer, in order to ensure the readability of the code, the specific content can be read [here](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/docs/contributions/code_styles.md#additional-style-rules).

However, it is difficult to ensure that the project code style is consistent by relying on written agreements to make specifications. So golang, like other languages, provides the official toolchain, such as [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint), [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt) , [goimports](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/cmd/goimports/doc.go) and [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet) etc. These tools can check and unify the code style before compilation, providing automation for subsequent processes such as code review. Currently PouchContainer runs the above code checking tool in CircleCI in the **every** developer's Pull Request. If the inspection tool displays an exception, the code reviewer has the right to **reject** the review, or even reject the merge code.

In addition to the official tools, we can also select third-party code checking tools in the open source community, such as [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck), it can be used to check if the developer has processed the **error** returned by the function.  However, these tools do not have a uniform output format, which makes it difficult to integrate the output of different tools. Fortunately, some people in the open source community have implemented this layer of unified interface, namely [gometalinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter), which can integrate various code checking tools. The recommended combination is:

* [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) - Google's (mostly stylistic) linter.
* [gofmt -s](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) - Checks if the code is properly formatted and could not be further simplified.
* [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) - Checks missing or unreferenced package imports.
* [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) - Reports potential errors that otherwise compile.
* [varcheck](https://github.com/opennota/check) - Find unused global variables and constants.
* [structcheck](https://github.com/opennota/check) - Find unused struct fields
* [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck) - Check that error return values are used.
* [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell) - Finds commonly misspelled English words.

Each project can be customized according to your needs.

## 1.2 Shellcheck - Reduce potential problems with shell script

Although shell scripts are powerful, they still require syntax checking to avoid potential, unpredictable errors. For example, the definition of unused variables, although it does not affect the use of the script, but its existence will become a burden for the project maintainer.

```powershell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pouch_version=0.5.x

dosomething() {
  echo "do something"
}

dosomething
```

PouchContainer will use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to check the shell script in the current project. Taking the above code as an example, shellcheck detection will get a warning of unused variables. This tool can detect potential problems with shell scripts during the code review phase, reducing the chance of runtime errors.

```plain
In test.sh line 3:
pouch_version=0.5.x
^-- SC2034: pouch_version appears unused. Verify it or export it.
```

PouchContainer's current continuous integration task will scan the `.sh` scripts in the project and check them one by one using the shellcheck. See [here](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L21-L24) for details .

> NOTE: When the shellcheck check is too strict, the project can be bypassed by a comment, or a check rule can be closed in the project. Specific check rules can be found at [here](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki).

## 1.3 Markdownlint - Unified Document Formatting

PouchContainer is an open source project and it's documentation is as important as the code's, because documentation is the best way for users to understand PouchContainer. The document is written in the form of markdown, and its formatting and spelling errors are the focus of the project.

As same as the code, if there is only a textual convention, there will still be a missed judgment, so PouchContainer uses [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) and [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell) to check the document format and spelling errors, these checks have the same status as `golint` and will run in CircleCI every time the Pull Request is executed. Once an exception occurs, the code reviewer has the right to **reject** review or merge the code.

PouchContainer's current continuous integration task checks the markdown document layout format in the project, and also checks the spelling of all files. For details, see [here](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L13-L20).

> NOTE: When the markdownlint request is too strict, the corresponding check can be closed in the project. Specific check items can be found at [here](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md).

## 1.4 Summary

All of the above are style discipline issues, and PouchContainer automates code specification detection and integrates into each code review to help reviewers identify potential problems.

## 2. How to write unit tests for golang
Unit tests can be used to ensure the correctness of a single module. In the pyramid of test, the wider the unit test coverage and the more comprehensive coverage, the more it can reduce the debugging costs of integration testing and end-to-end testing. In a complex system, the longer the link processed by the task, the higher the cost of the location problem, especially the problems caused by small modules. The following sections share a summary of PouchContainer's preparation of golang unit test cases.

## 2.1 Table-Driven<span data-type="color" style="color:rgb(36, 41, 46)"><span data-type="background" style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> </span></span>Test - DRY


A simple understanding of unit testing is to give a given input to a function to determine if the expected output can be obtained. When the function being tested has a variety of input scenarios, we can organize our test cases in the form of Table-Driven, as shown in the next code. Table-Driven uses arrays to organize test cases and validate the correctness of the function by loop execution.

```go
// from https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing
package stringutil

import "testing"

func TestReverse(t *testing.T) {
	cases := []struct {
		in, want string
	}{
		{"Hello, world", "dlrow ,olleH"},
		{"Hello, 世界", "界世 ,olleH"},
		{"", ""},
	}
	for _, c := range cases {
		got := Reverse(c.in)
		if got != c.want {
			t.Errorf("Reverse(%q) == %q, want %q", c.in, got, c.want)
		}
	}
}
```

To facilitate debugging and maintenance of test cases, we can add some auxiliary information to describe the current test. For example, if you want to test the input of punycode, if you do not include the word punycode, for code reviewers or project maintainers, they may not know the difference between xn - bcher-kva.tld / redis:3 and docker.io/library/ Redis: 3.

```go
{
		name:  "Normal",
		input: "docker.io/library/nginx:alpine",
		expected: taggedReference{
			Named: namedReference{"docker.io/library/nginx"},
			tag:   "alpine",
		},
		err: nil,
}, {
		name:  "Punycode",
		input: "xn--bcher-kva.tld/redis:3",
		expected: taggedReference{
			Named: namedReference{"xn--bcher-kva.tld/redis"},
			tag:   "3",
		},
		err: nil,
}
```

However, some functions are more complicated, and one input cannot be used as a complete test case. For example, [TestTeeReader](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.9/src/io/io_test.go#L284) and TeeReader read the <span data-type="color" style="color:rgb(3, 47, 98)"><span data-type="background" style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"><code>hello, world</code></span></span><span data-type="color" style="color:rgb(3, 47, 98)"><span data-type="background" style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> </span></span><span data-type="background" style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> from the buffer, and the data has been read. If you read it again, the expected behavior is an end-of-file error. Such a test case needs to be done in a single case, without the need to hard-bake the form of Table-Driven.</span>

Simply,if you test a function that needs to copy most of the code, theoretically the test code can be extracted and used to organize test cases using Table-Driven. <strong><span data-type="color" style="color:#F5222D">Don`t Repeat Yourself</span></strong><span data-type="color" style="color:#F5222D"> </span> is our principle.

> NOTE: The organization of Table-Driven is recommended by the golang community. Please[check here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) for details.

## 2.2 Mock - Simulating external dependencies

There are often problems with dependencies during the testing process. For example, the PouchContainer client requires an HTTP server, but this is too heavy for the unit, and this is a category of integration testing. So how do you complete this part of the unit test?

In the world of golang, the implementation of the interface belongs to [Duck Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).An interface can have a variety of implementations, as long as the implementation conforms to the interface definition. If the external dependencies are constrained by the interface, then the dependency behavior is simulated in the unit test. The following content will share two common test scenarios.

### 2.2.1 RoundTripper

PouchContainer client test,for example, The PouchContainer client uses [http.Client](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Client)。The http.Client uses [RoundTripper](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#RoundTripper) interface to perform an HTTP request, which allows developers to customize the logic for sending HTTP requests. This is also an important reason why golang can perfectly support the HTTP 2 protocol on an original basis.

```plain
http.Client -> http.RoundTripper [http.DefaultTransport]
```

For the PouchContainer client, the test focus is mainly on whether the incoming destination address is correct, whether the incoming query is reasonable, and whether the result can be returned normally. So before testing, developers need to prepare the corresponding RoundTripper implementation, which is not responsible for the actual business logic, it is only used to determine whether the input meets expectations.

As shown in the next code,PouchContainer `newMockClient` accepts custom request processing logic. In the use case of testing to remove the image, the developer determines in the custom logic whether the destination address and the HTTP Method are DELETE, so that the functional test can be completed without starting the HTTP Server.

```go
// https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/client/client_mock_test.go#L12-L22
type transportFunc func(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)

func (transFunc transportFunc) RoundTrip(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
        return transFunc(req)
}

func newMockClient(handler func(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)) *http.Client {
        return &http.Client{
                Transport: transportFunc(handler),
        }
}

// https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/client/image_remove_test.go
func TestImageRemove(t *testing.T) {
        expectedURL := "/images/image_id"

        httpClient := newMockClient(func(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
                if !strings.HasPrefix(req.URL.Path, expectedURL) {
                        return nil, fmt.Errorf("expected URL '%s', got '%s'", expectedURL, req.URL)
                }
                if req.Method != "DELETE" {
                        return nil, fmt.Errorf("expected DELETE method, got %s", req.Method)
                }

                return &http.Response{
                        StatusCode: http.StatusNoContent,
                        Body:       ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader([]byte(""))),
                }, nil
        })

        client := &APIClient{
                HTTPCli: httpClient,
        }

        err := client.ImageRemove(context.Background(), "image_id", false)
        if err != nil {
                t.Fatal(err)
        }
}
```

### 2.2.2 MockImageManager

For dependencies between internal packages, such as the PouchContainer Image API Bridge relies on the PouchContainer daemon ImageManager, where the dependency behavior comes from the interface convention. If you want to test the logic of Image Bridge, we don't have to start the container. We just need to implement the corresponding daemon ImageManager like RoundTripper.

```go
// https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/apis/server/image_bridge_test.go
type mockImgePull struct {
        mgr.ImageMgr
        handler func(ctx context.Context, imageRef string, authConfig *types.AuthConfig, out io.Writer) error
}

func (m *mockImgePull) PullImage(ctx context.Context, imageRef string, authConfig *types.AuthConfig, out io.Writer) error {
        return m.handler(ctx, imageRef, authConfig, out)
}

func Test_pullImage_without_tag(t *testing.T) {
        var s Server

        s.ImageMgr = &mockImgePull{
                ImageMgr: &mgr.ImageManager{},
                handler: func(ctx context.Context, imageRef string, authConfig *types.AuthConfig, out io.Writer) error {
                        assert.Equal(t, "reg.abc.com/base/os:7.2", imageRef)
                        return nil
                },
        }
        req := &http.Request{
                Form:   map[string][]string{"fromImage": {"reg.abc.com/base/os:7.2"}},
                Header: map[string][]string{},
        }
        s.pullImage(context.Background(), nil, req)
}
```

### 2.2.3 Conclusion

ImageManager and RoundTripper are modeled in the same way except for the number of functions defined by the interface. In general, developers can manually define a structure that uses methods as fields, as shown in the following code.

```go
type Do interface {
    Add(x int, y int) int
    Sub(x int, y int) int
}

type mockDo struct {
    addFunc func(x int, y int) int
    subFunc func(x int, y int) int
}

// Add implements Do.Add function.
type (m *mockDo) Add(x int, y int) int {
    return m.addFunc(x, y)
}

// Sub implements Do.Sub function.
type (m *mockDo) Sub(x int, y int) int {
    return m.subFunc(x, y)
}
```

When the interface is large and complex, the manual method will impose a test burden on the developer, so the community provides automatically generated tools, such as [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) To ease the burden on developers.

## 2.3 Other partial doors

Sometimes it relies on third-party services, such as the PouchContainer client, which is a typical case. The above describes Duck Type to complete the test of this case. In addition, we can also complete the request processing by registering the http.Handler and starting mockHTTPServer. This way of testing is relatively heavy, it is recommended to consider to use when it cannot complete Duck Type test, or put it into the integration test.

> NOTE: Someone in the golang community has done [monkeypatch](https://github.com/bouk/monkey) by modifying the binary code. This tool is not recommended, but recommend that developers design and write testable code.

## 2.4 Summary

PouchContainer integrates unit test cases into the code review phase, and reviewers can view the running of test cases at any time.

# 3. Summary

In the code review phase, code style checking, unit testing, and integration testing should be run through continuous integration to help reviewers make accurate decisions, while PouchContainer currently relies on TravisCI/CircleCI and [pouchrobot](https://github.com/pouchcontainer/pouchrobot) to complete code style checking and testing.
